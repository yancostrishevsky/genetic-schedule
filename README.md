# Goodlood's schedule generator using genetic algorithm
### The idea was to create a program that would create an optimal employee schedule with the following restrictions:
- Manager must be assigned to the first and third shift
- Do not assign to shift that the employee does not want
- The number of employee shifts must be about the same
- The same employee should be assigned up to 2 shifts per day, but shifts cannot overlap in time
